### Numbers and some important facts:<br/>
To implement integer division:<br/>
Math.floor => round down to nearest integer<br/>
Math.round => round to the nearest integer<br/>
Math.ceil => round up to the nearest integer<br/>
Math.random( )=> built-in function to generate numbers in JS.<br/>
This function returns numbers between 0 and 1.<br/>
To get floating numbers higher than 1, simply multiply Math.random() * 100 // floats between 0 and 100.<br/> 
Math.pow(2,3);// 8 <br/>
### Prime Number Validation:
It is the simple act of verifying if a number is prime or not.<br/>
What is a prime number?<br/>
A number that can be divided by itself and by 1.<br/>
#### Prime Number and Cryptography<br/>
For the use of the RSA algorithm: we need to verify if the numbers used are prime numbers.<br/><br/>
<strong>RSA</strong><strong> only works with prime numbers</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Bitcoins</strong> also use prime numbers.<br/>
The <strong>SSH passwords generation</strong> also need to use prime Numbers.<br/><br/>

#### Prime Factorization:<br/>
It means to decompose a number in its prime factors.<br/>
What are the prime factors?<br/>
Numbers that multiplied between each of them, it give you the original number.<br/>
Example:<br/>
12  = 2*6 <br/>
    =  2 * 2 * 3<br/>
    = 2² * 3 <br/>
Math.sqrt(4) // output 2 <br/>
Math.sqrt(64) // output 8 <br/>
